AJAX

Before AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) concept was introduced, 
- to update the portion of a page
- browsers used to make a request for a "full web page" to the server
- after the request was received by the server, 
    it used to create & return a page to the browser as a response. 
- It means that even for a small change the page was loaded entirely. 
- very very bad.

AJAX came and changed the traditional way of updating the page. 
With AJAX, Web applications were able to send & retrieve data from a server asynchronously 
- in the background
- without interfering with the display & behaviour of the existing page.
- users dont need to do refresh/reload


XMLHttpRequest
- In 2006, WWW Constortium published a Working Draft specification for the XMLHttpRequest object. 
- XMLHttpRequest object is used to retrieve data from a server asynchronously.
- In the initial stages, XMLHttpRequest used to fetch XML data over HTTP hence the name. 
- But today 
    it can be used with protocols other than HTTP
    it can fetch data not only in the form of XML but also JSON, HTML, plain text.

But now even XMLHttpRequest is kind of obsolete
people shifted to fetch API
